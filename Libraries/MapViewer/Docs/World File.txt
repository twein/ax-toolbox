World File name:
	Option 1: same name as bitmap file, but the extension is first+third letters from bitmap file extension plus 'w'. e.g. png->pgw, jpg->jgw.
	Option 2: same name as bitmap file, but the extension is the bitmap file extension plus 'w'. e.g. png->pngw, jpg->jpgw.

World file content:
	Line1: a
	Line2: c
	Line3: b
	Line4: d
	Line5: deltax
	Line6: deltay

	where:

	bitmap (x,y) to map (x',y') matrix coordinate transformation: 

	|x'| = |a b| |x| + |deltax|
	|y'|   |c d| |y|   |deltay|

	x' = a*x + b*y + deltax
	y' = c*x + d*y + deltay


BUG: Use only bitmaps @ 96dpi!
