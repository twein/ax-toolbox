TO DO
! PDF report
  Add event title to settings
! think about measure/result/constraint thing
(needs to be checked) think about the area/filter for competition area and exclusion areas: when filter is ouside task, it is assumed to filter the competition area
- global penalties instead of task specific:
	for each task:
		if task has no result goto next task
		filter the flightTrack from first to last used point for that task
		compute the penalty over the filtered track points
		assign penalty to task
		next task
	if there are remaining points,
	compute the penalty over the remaining points
	assign penalty to last task with a result if any or
	assign penalty to last task

- Competition area and exclusion areas
- Area addition
- Add a new type of point: TLU Track point last used: Last used point in any task
- MPDGF: tasks in any order: think about how to check if the declaration has been done before the last marker drop 
- MPDGF: tasks in order: what happens if the previous marker is invalid (too high, out of scoring area...)
- rewrite the examples in the AXS Specification for new syntax
* remove mintime and maxtime from MPDG. It can be programmed with restrictions.
* add TBEFORE(<point>,<time of day>) and TAFTER(<point>,<time of day>): the point must happen before or after the given time of day


How to set different tasks:
	3DS: apply a filter for each area. the result is a DACC
