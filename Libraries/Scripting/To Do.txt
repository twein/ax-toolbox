
TO DO
- MVMDP Previous task marker or launch point (for PDG FON restrictions)
- TDT and TDD: remove maxTime parameters? -> use filter instead?
+ R13.3.5 table of distance infringement penalties. ("For Elbow, Angle and Land Run Tasks, the percent infringements will be the sum of the percent infringements of each ‘leg’" not implemented)

- Add a new type of point: TLU Track point last used: Last used point in any task
- fix BPZ and RPZ penalties for CSG areas

- Scripting object inheritance instead of switch case
? check for repeated task numbers
- make axpoint, axwaypoint, immutable. Rewrite CleanTrack, FlightTrack & Co.
- checkbox scripting object: shown in a separate window, the user must check all checkboxes before being allowed to save. Show in the report too?
- Add the possibility of warning the user programmatically.
- restriction: non split tasks: check for no markers in between
- Fix the text of distance infringement, it's not the infringement, it's the distance
! GoalDeclaration coordinates: don't parse at load time?. Don't assume anything: check 1111, 1111/, 111, 1111/1111, etc.
! think about measure/result/constraint/filter/restriction thing
- Add SAMEAREA and DIFFERENTAREA restrictions
- list of all debriefers that worked on a flight report
- when a LRN result has ben overriden by a restriction, the result still shows on map. Check other types as well (e.g. Europeans2011, task 10, pilot 45)
- Area type BOX
! rewrite the examples in the AXS Specification for new syntax
? multiple MMA in HWZ, PDG, FON (not a good idea. The GPS performance should always be worse than ANY physical marker performance)

* remove mintime and maxtime from MPDG. It can be programmed with restrictions.
* add TBEFORE(<point>,<time of day>) and TAFTER(<point>,<time of day>): the point must happen before or after the given time of day
* Add event title to settings
* Competition area and exclusion areas
* think about the area/filter for competition area and exclusion areas: when filter is ouside task, it is assumed to filter the competition area
* global penalties instead of task specific
* implement VSMAX
* Finish PDF report
* check if http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/elevation/ is better
* in result and penalty, use point pairs for different entry/exit pairs instead of usedpoints. For single points, use point/null pair
* altitude units on pdf reports
* altitude units in settings
* fix the demo files for new syntax
* Area CSG
* Use contest landing if no marker has been produced for a given task.

How to set different tasks:
	3DS: apply a filter for each area. the result is a DACC
