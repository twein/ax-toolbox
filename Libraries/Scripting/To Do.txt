TO DO
- Fix the text of distance infringement, it's not the infringement, it's the distance
! GoalDeclaration coordinates: don't parse at load time?. Don't assume anything: check 1111, 1111/, 111, 1111/1111, etc.
! think about measure/result/constraint/filter/restriction thing
- in result and penalty, use point pairs for different entry/exit pairs instead usedpoints. For single points, use point/null pair
- Add SAMEAREA and DIFFERENTAREA restrictions
- command to update altitude in pdg?
- altitude units on pdf reports
- list of all debriefers that worked on a flight report
- when a LRN result has ben overriden by a restriction, the result still shows on map. Check other types as well (e.g. Europeans2011, task 10, pilot 45)
- Area type BOX
- Area CSG?
- Add a new type of point: TLU Track point last used: Last used point in any task
- MPDGF: tasks in any order: think about how to check if the declaration has been done before the last marker drop 
- MPDGF: tasks in order: what happens if the previous marker is invalid (too high, out of scoring area...)
- rewrite the examples in the AXS Specification for new syntax
- fix the demo files for new syntax

* remove mintime and maxtime from MPDG. It can be programmed with restrictions.
* add TBEFORE(<point>,<time of day>) and TAFTER(<point>,<time of day>): the point must happen before or after the given time of day
* Add event title to settings
* Competition area and exclusion areas
* think about the area/filter for competition area and exclusion areas: when filter is ouside task, it is assumed to filter the competition area
* global penalties instead of task specific
* implement VSMAX
* Finish PDF report

How to set different tasks:
	3DS: apply a filter for each area. the result is a DACC
