BUGS
- Vertical distance infraction: check CICR2011, task 9, pilot 2: the goal declaration track point is between track sample interval!!!

TO DO
- The options window does not save the bitmap scaling mode
! The automatic launch and landing points should not be shown as set by debriefer
* Use contest landing if no marker has been produced for a given task.
* R13.3.5 table of distance infringement penalties
- Update async workflow with .NET 4.5 (async/await instead of BackgroundWorker?)
? the debriefer must enter all the physical marker performances before being allowed to save
! Add/remove penalties.
- full IsDirty management.
? Don't score counterfeit logs.
- Getting started with FlightAnalyzer
* Fix the log files thing
* Batch process flight reports.
* Fix add/remove goal declarations. Support null altitude
* take off and landing helper buttons in tools
* pilot names in a file defined in settings (like instrument error file)
* taskbar jump lists
* multiple file section in batch processing
* progressbar in batch processing
* pdf report: add the same notes in goaldeclarations and markers as in take off and landing (modified by...)
