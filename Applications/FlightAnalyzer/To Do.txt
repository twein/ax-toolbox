PENDING
- Display correctly AXTrackpoint.StartSubtrack
- Check the workflow of BindableObject.IsDirty

TO DO
- think about measure/result/contstraint thing
- Add logger altitude correction file support
- Keep track of debriefer identity. Assign pilot ranges to each debriefer?

- List of saved reports.
* Add distance measure tool (shift-click) to MapViewer.
- Add metadata to all pdfs
- Getting started with FlightAnalyzer

IDEAS
- Make an error log to output all recoverable error causes.
- Steal ideas from http://boxy.fisch.lu
- Add a new type of point: TLU Track point last used: Last used point in any task
