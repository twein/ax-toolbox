BUGS
- Vertical distance infraction: check CICR2011, task 9, pilot 2: the goal declaration track point is between track sample interval!!!

TO DO
- checkbox scripting object: shown in a separate window, the user must check all checkboxes before being allowed to save. Show in the report too?
- the debriefer must enter all the physical marker performances before being allowed to save
- launch and landing helper buttons in tools
- pilot names in a file defined in settings (like instrument error file)
- ribbon
- multiple MMA in HWZ, PDG, FON
- pdf report: add the same notes in goaldeclarations and markers as in launch and landing (modified by...)
- multiple file section in batch processing
- progressbar in batch processing
! Add/remove penalties.
- full IsDirty management.
- Add the possibility of warning the user programmatically.
- Mark manually added markers and declarations. Don't allow to delete non-manual ones.
- Assign pilot ranges to each debriefer?
- Don't score counterfeit logs.
- List of saved reports.
- Getting started with FlightAnalyzer
* Keep track of debriefer identity. 
* Fix the log files thing
* Batch process flight reports.
* Fix add/remove goal declarations. Support null altitude
