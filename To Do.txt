Mark manually added markers and declarations. Don't allow to delete non-manual ones.
Perform all measurements and penalizations in FlightAnalyzer.
Force analyzing of all assigned pilots?
List of saved reports.
*Add distance measure tool (shift-click) to MapViewer.
Add metadata to all pdfs

IDEAS
Make an error log to output all recoverable error causes.
Steal ideas from http://boxy.fisch.lu
Add a new type of point: TLU Track point last used: Last used point in any task

R13
Result: distance, angle, group B (apply when "… will not achieve a result.")

How to set different tasks:
3DS: apply a filter for each area. the result is a DACC


RULES:
Read all COH!
Checksum: the last four characters of the sum of all competitors' scores multiplied by their number. (COH13.33.2)
