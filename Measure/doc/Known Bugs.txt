KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

BUGS:

1:  Scoring areas not linked to targets
	The scoring areas in the same task are not linked to a specific target. In some 
	configurations this could lead a trackpoint scoring to a target outside 
	"its" scoring area, but inside another target's area.
		
	Example:

		Hesitation waltz
		Target 1 with a scoring radius of 50m
		Target 2 with a scoring radius of 200m 
			(yeah! I know! All targets should have the same scoring radius, but...)
		Target 1 and 2 are 220m apart
		
		If there is a track point over the line connecting A and B, 60m from A 
		and 160m from B, the best score would be 60m from A in spite it's ouside 
		A's scoring area, because it's inside B's scoring area.
		
	
2: References must be in a specific order for ANG and ELB tasks
	ANG: The reference point must be in the first place and the direction in the second
	ELB: The references must be in the same order as stated in the rules: A, B, C
	

3: The computed MaxDistanceInside for an area with concave polygonal shape may not be correct.
	It is the maximum distance between any points in the polygon, and not the maximum
	distance that can be traveled inside.
