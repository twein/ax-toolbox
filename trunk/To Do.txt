TO DO
Add notes for every user action.
Make a different Gmap marker object (like Tag) for point and another for waypoint (with circle support). 
Keep track of debriefer identity. Assign pilot ranges to each debriefer?
Don't score counterfeit logs.
Mark manually added markers and declarations. Don't allow to delete non-manual ones.
Make all measurements and penalizations in FlightAnalyzer.
Force analyzing of all assigned pilots?
List of saved reports.
