	ADD SYNTAX CHECKING!

	Make a list of use cases.


LINEPARSER:

	Support escaped quotes inside quotes


POINTS:

	pointlist.SaveTrack: Set track color & thickness

	pointlist.RemoveWrongPoints: try to remove points using changes in direction


FLIGHT:

	Parallelize the computation (by pilot).

	Add the gap threshold for interpolation as a parameter. (time gaps bigger than this will not be filled with interpolated points) 

	Add new interpolation methods (bezier curves?, cuadratic curves?)

TASK:

	Implement tags "open" and "close" (internallu using areas)

	MDT: Implement minimum distance of flight.

	3DS: Implement scoring by time inside.

	Reference: Remove the keyword "reference" and replace it by "goal" and "direction". Internally they are the same. Or make two separate classes?

	MeasureBox: compute not using Area.AccumulatedDistance2D


REFERENCE:



AREA:


PENALTY:

	Add more penalty types: "angle".


RESULT:


OTHER:

	Add degrees<->UTM conversions:

		http://home.hiwaay.net/~taylorc/bookshelf/math-science/geodesy/datum/transform/molodensky/

	Add various load/save functions (for waypoints, tracks, ozi, CompeGPS...)
